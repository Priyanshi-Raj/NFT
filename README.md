## 👬 Features
We have created a platform where we have addressed the common problems that students face in college.
On our website, students will find the best online resources to study from, be aware of various hackathons, contests and college events, connect with seniors, find the best places nearby to drive their taste when they bored by the same old mess food, report any case of ragging.
They can also have fun connecting with their peers on games like skribbl, among us,etc.
They can even connect with their alumni with right guidance.



## 🚀 Future Plans
- Integrate Smart Contract
- Add more domains to own
- Platform to create Digital Art
